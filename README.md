# Encryption-Decryption-Program
A project that involves both web development and C++ for encryption and decryption of files uploaded to a web application. I've made an four page frontend model to upload files for operations viz. encryption and decryption and download operated files.
 In the digital age, securing sensitive information is paramount. Our Encryption and Decryption Tool is designed to provide robust security for your data, ensuring that your information remains confidential and protected from unauthorized access. Whether you're a developer, business professional, or simply someone who values privacy, our tool offers a reliable solution for encrypting and decrypting data with ease.
This application uses C++ programs to encrypt and decrypt the uploaded files by using Node.js and Express.js for creating server and connecting the C++ programs with the frontend model. As there is scope for improving the experience and interface, you can share your feedbacks on contact page.
